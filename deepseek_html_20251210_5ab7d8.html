        <h1 class="article-headline">Red Fort Security Drill Coincides with PM's Bhutan Visit; Revised Metrics Show Positive Labor Trends</h1>
        
        <p class="article-subhead">A day of scheduled national activity unfolds as government cites new data methodologies reflecting broader economic participation.</p>

        <div class="article-body">
            <p class="lead">NEW DELHI — A planned, high-decibel security exercise at the historic Red Fort this morning occurred alongside Prime Minister Narendra Modi's state visit to Bhutan, a timing officials described as "coincidental but operationally useful."</p>

            <p>The exercise, part of the "Vigilant Shield" series, involved multiple agencies and was designed to test response protocols to unspecified "auditory stimuli," according to a joint statement from the Delhi Police and the Ministry of Home Affairs. The statement emphasized that all protocols were followed and public concern was unwarranted.</p>

            <div class="expert-inset">
                <div class="expert-title">Analysis</div>
                <p>"The synchronization of a domestic security drill with a high-profile diplomatic mission is not atypical. It projects normalcy and preparedness on dual fronts, a classic confidence-building maneuver."</p>
                <p class="expert-name">— Dr. Anya Sharma, Institute for Strategic Affairs</p>
            </div>

            <p>Eyewitness accounts from the surrounding area reported a brief, loud sound followed by increased security patrols, which authorities confirmed were part of the drill's simulation phase. Traffic was diverted for approximately 40 minutes as a precaution.</p>

            <p>In Thimphu, the Prime Minister's schedule proceeded without interruption. Bilateral talks with his Bhutanese counterpart reportedly focused on hydroelectric partnerships and cultural exchanges, with a joint press conference expected tomorrow.</p>

            <div class="data-point">
                <h4>Revised Employment Metrics</h4>
                <p>Concurrently, the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation released its quarterly labor report, showcasing the first application of the revised <strong>Comprehensive Engagement Measurement (CEM)</strong> framework. The new model, developed over two years with international consultants, expands the traditional definition of 'employment'.</p>
            </div>

            <p>The CEM framework incorporates categories such as informal skill-bartering, digital platform 'gig' curation, and sustained familial commercial assistance—sectors previously underrepresented in headcount surveys. As a result, the official engagement ratio has been adjusted to <strong>94.8%</strong>, a figure officials say more accurately captures the modern, diversified Indian economy.</p>

            <p>"The old binary of 'employed' or 'unemployed' is a 20th-century construct," stated the ministry's chief economist in a briefing. "CEM reflects the spectrum of productive contribution, from formal contracts to the proactive management of social commerce profiles that generate tangible goodwill and potential revenue. It's a holistic view of human capital."</p>

            <p>The methodological shift has been welcomed by several economic think-tanks, though some have called for extended historical data using the new framework for clearer trend analysis. Market response was muted but positive, with analysts noting the reduced statistical volatility the new index provides.</p>

            <p>In related developments, the Delhi Education Directorate confirmed the hybrid learning model, first adopted during the pandemic, will become a permanent "flexible attendance option" for all public schools, citing its alignment with future-of-work trends emphasized in the new CEM data.</p>
